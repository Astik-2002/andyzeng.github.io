# Personal Website

This is a simple template for personal or academic websites. 
Notably, this uses [Isotope JS](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to create subpages.
So technically, you can get fancy with "sort by category" animations if you wanted to. Just change the HTML `data-category` fields and Isotope parameters in the JS code at the bottom of `index.html`.

Feel free to download this for your own personal use. I'd appreciate a link back to my website. Inspired by [Jon Barron](https://jonbarron.info/).
